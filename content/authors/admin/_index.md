I'm a professor of political science at SUNY Oneonta who has interests in law and courts. He teaches a range of public law courses--Law Courts and Politics, Civil Rights and Liberties, and American Constitutional Development--US Government and research methods. I am also interested in R and data visualization. 

Born in Wichita, Kansas and raised in Texas, I have lived in upstate New York for the last 30-plus years. I enjoy cycling and wandering around taking photos with my wife Jennifer. I am the board of the Schenectady Greenmarket. Come visit us on Sundays from 10am - 2pm. 

On wilkersite, I hope to explore some of my interests with occasional posts and information about my teaching.
